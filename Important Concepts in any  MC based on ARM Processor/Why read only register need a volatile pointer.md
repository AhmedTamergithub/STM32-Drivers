In STM32 (or any other microcontroller), when you have a read-only register, you still need to define a pointer to that register as volatile. Here’s why:
1. Hardware Interaction

Read-only registers in microcontrollers often reflect the state of hardware peripherals, such as status flags, sensor data, or interrupt flags. These registers can be updated by hardware at any moment, independently of the program's flow.

    For example, a read-only register may store the result of an analog-to-digital conversion or the status of a GPIO pin. The value in that register can change asynchronously as the hardware operates.

2. Compiler Optimization

When the C compiler sees a variable or pointer that is not marked as volatile, it assumes that the value won’t change unless explicitly modified by the program (through code). This allows the compiler to optimize the code by caching values in CPU registers or optimizing away redundant reads.

However, in the case of hardware registers, the value may change due to external factors (i.e., hardware events), but the compiler doesn't know that. Without volatile, the compiler might optimize out necessary reads from the register, assuming that its value remains constant.

    Example without volatile: If the compiler sees code like while (status_register == 0);, it might optimize this into a loop that checks the value of status_register only once, assuming it doesn't change (because there’s no explicit modification in the code).

    In reality, the hardware may change the value of status_register at any time. Without marking the register as volatile, the program may not correctly detect these hardware changes, leading to incorrect behavior.

3. Volatile Keyword

The volatile keyword tells the compiler:

    "Do not optimize out any access to this variable (or register)."
    "Always fetch the value from memory (or the hardware register) every time it is accessed."

This is critical for hardware registers because they can change at any time due to external events that the program cannot predict.
4. Example in Code

Here’s how you might define a volatile pointer to a read-only register:

c

#define STATUS_REGISTER  (*(volatile uint32_t*) 0x40011010U)

    volatile: Ensures the compiler reads the value of the register every time it's accessed, preventing any caching or optimization.
    uint32_t: The data type of the register (e.g., 32-bit register).
    0x40011010U: The address of the hardware register in the STM32 memory map.

Summary

You need to define a volatile pointer to a read-only register because the value of the register can change due to hardware events, and volatile ensures that the compiler does not optimize out necessary reads, allowing your program to respond to changes in the register correctly.
