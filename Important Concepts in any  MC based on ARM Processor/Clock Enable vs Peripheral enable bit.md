In ARM-based microcontrollers (like those in the STM32 series), the need for both an enable bit for the peripheral and an enable bit for the clock to that peripheral is rooted in power efficiency, system performance, and modularity. Here's a breakdown of why these two are necessary:
1. Clock Gating for Power Efficiency

ARM-based microcontrollers often run on constrained power sources (e.g., battery-powered devices). Power consumption is a key concern, and clocks consume power when they run.

    Clock Enable Bit: Every peripheral in the microcontroller is connected to the system clock. By default, clocks to many peripherals are disabled to save power. When you want to use a peripheral, you first need to enable the clock for it. This ensures that the peripheral's logic is actively clocked and can operate.
        Example: In STM32 microcontrollers, the RCC (Reset and Clock Control) register contains enable bits for clocks to different peripherals (like GPIO, ADC, USART, etc.).

By gating (turning on/off) the clock to peripherals when they are not in use, you reduce unnecessary power consumption.
2. Peripheral Enable Bit for Functionality Control

Even if the clock is provided to a peripheral, you may want the peripheral to remain inactive until you explicitly enable it. That's where the Peripheral Enable Bit comes into play.

    Peripheral Enable Bit: This bit is used to control the operational state of the peripheral itself. It usually activates the internal logic, functionality, and interrupts associated with the peripheral.
        Example: For a UART peripheral, the enable bit might allow the UART module to send or receive data, while the clock enable bit ensures that the UART module has the necessary clock signal to operate.

Why Separate Clock Enable and Peripheral Enable?

    Fine-Grained Control: By separating clock control and peripheral functionality, the system provides greater flexibility. You can disable the peripheral logic (e.g., stop its functions) while keeping its clock enabled for other purposes (like status registers or debugging).

    Reduced Power Consumption: The clock enable bit allows the system to reduce dynamic power consumption by disabling the clock signal to peripherals when not in use. Even if the peripheral is disabled but its clock remains enabled, it can still draw power.

    Avoiding Unintentional Operation: If the peripheral were enabled but the clock wasn't, it could lead to unpredictable behavior (like missing data or timing issues). Conversely, if the clock is enabled but the peripheral is disabled, it guarantees that no unintended activity occurs, even though the peripheral might still be powered.

    Performance Considerations: In real-time applications, starting and stopping peripherals or changing clock speeds dynamically helps in managing performance. Some peripherals might need to be enabled at full speed, while others can remain dormant until required.

Example: STM32 Peripherals

In STM32 microcontrollers, this is often seen:

    The clock to a peripheral (e.g., GPIOx_EN in the RCC register) needs to be enabled to ensure that the peripheral receives the clock.
    The peripheral itself is enabled by setting its enable bit in its respective control register (e.g., USARTx_CR1 for UART, where the UE bit enables the UART peripheral).

This division allows for power management (by disabling clocks) and system robustness (by explicitly controlling peripheral activation).
